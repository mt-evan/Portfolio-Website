      "imageSrc": "projects/project.png",
      "description": "This project developed a speech-to-speech synthesis system that inputs English audio and outputs it in any of 17 different languages while preserving the original voice characteristics. The system utilizes Whisper for accurate speech-to-text conversion, achieving 95% translation accuracy. The translated text is then processed using Coqui TTS to convert it back into audio, maintaining the original tone and intonation, with the capability to process up to 50 audio files per hour.",
