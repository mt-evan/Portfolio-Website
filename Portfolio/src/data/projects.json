      "imageSrc": "projects/project.png",
      "description": "I developed a speech-to-speech synthesis system that converts English audio into any of 17 different languages while preserving the original voice characteristics. The system utilizes Whisper for highly accurate speech-to-text conversion with 95% translation accuracy. The translated text is then processed using Coqui TTS to regenerate audio, maintaining the original tone and intonation. The system is capable of processing up to 50 audio files per hour, making it both fast and efficient.",

      "imageSrc": "projects/project.png",
      "description": "I created a web application that helps users maintain a healthy diet by logging meals and receiving personalized AI-driven meal recommendations. The frontend, built with React and Bootstrap, offers a seamless user experience with sub-200ms response times. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, efficiently handles thousands of meal entries and user authentication. MongoDB is used for fast data storage and retrieval, while machine learning models developed in Python and TensorFlow analyze meal patterns, achieving 85% recommendation accuracy.",
