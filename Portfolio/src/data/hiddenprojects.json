        "description": "I built a 2D platform game inspired by the classic Kirby, using TypeScript and the Kaboom.js library. The game features a custom level/map constructed with Tiled. Players can jump using the X key and use special abilities with the Z key. The game recreates the nostalgic feel of Kirby with modern development tools, making it both fun and technically interesting.",
